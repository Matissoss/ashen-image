# About

ashen-image is simple CLI tool for changing any image's colors to be based on [ashen.nvim](https://github.com/ficcdaf/ashen.nvim) palette.

# Examples

Examples can be found in my other repo: [ashen-wallpapers](https://github.com/Matissoss/ashen-wallpapers)

# Usage

Firstly download CLI from releases (or compile from source).

Then use CLI with `ashen-image --input=image.png --output=output.png` to transform your images. Use `--help` flag for more info

ashen-color supports image formats supported by Rust's crate named "image", which supports most of formats you'd use
